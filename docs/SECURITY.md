- No audit logging for file operations

## Authentication

### NFS: RPCSEC_GSS (Kerberos)

DittoFS implements RPCSEC_GSS authentication per RFC 2203, enabling Kerberos-based strong authentication for NFSv4 clients. This is the recommended authentication method for any deployment outside of a fully trusted network.

When enabled, clients authenticate using Kerberos tickets. The server validates tickets against its keytab and maps Kerberos principals to Unix UID/GID for authorization decisions.

Key properties:
- Mutual authentication (server identity is also verified by the client)
- Cryptographic credential verification (no trust-based UID spoofing)
- Configurable context lifetime and clock skew tolerance
- Hot-reload support for keytab rotation without server restart

See [Kerberos Configuration](#kerberos-configuration) for setup instructions.

### NFS: AUTH_UNIX

AUTH_UNIX is the traditional NFS authentication mechanism. The client provides UID, GID, and supplementary GIDs with each request. The server trusts these values without independent verification.

- Suitable for trusted networks only
- Clients can impersonate any user by sending arbitrary UID/GID values
- Use identity mapping (root squash, all squash) to limit exposure

### NFS: AUTH_NULL

AUTH_NULL provides anonymous access with no authentication. All requests are treated as coming from an unauthenticated user. Use with extreme caution and only for public read-only shares.

### SMB: Kerberos via SPNEGO

The SMB adapter supports Kerberos authentication through the SPNEGO (Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism) protocol during SESSION_SETUP. When a Kerberos provider is configured, SMB clients can authenticate using Kerberos tickets.

When Kerberos is not configured, the SMB adapter falls back to NTLM or guest authentication.

See [Kerberos Configuration](#kerberos-configuration) for shared Kerberos setup that applies to both NFS and SMB.

## SMB3 Security Model

SMB3 (dialects 3.0, 3.0.2, and 3.1.1) introduces significant security improvements over SMB2, including encryption, stronger signing algorithms, preauth integrity for downgrade protection, and enhanced key derivation. This section covers the SMB3 security features implemented in DittoFS.

See [docs/SMB.md](SMB.md) for complete wire format details and configuration examples.

### SMB3 Encryption

SMB3 provides encryption using AEAD (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) ciphers, delivering both confidentiality and integrity for all messages on an encrypted session.

**Supported cipher suites:**

| Cipher | Dialect | Key Size | Performance |
|--------|---------|----------|-------------|
| AES-128-GCM | 3.1.1 (default) | 128-bit | Fastest (AES-NI + CLMUL hardware acceleration) |
| AES-128-CCM | 3.0/3.0.2 (default) | 128-bit | Good (AES-NI acceleration) |
| AES-256-GCM | 3.1.1 | 256-bit | Fast (higher security, slightly slower than 128) |
| AES-256-CCM | 3.0+ | 256-bit | Good (highest security AES-CCM variant) |

**Encryption modes:**

- **`disabled`**: No encryption. Suitable for testing only.
- **`preferred`**: SMB 3.x sessions are encrypted; unencrypted SMB 2.x sessions are still accepted. Recommended for mixed environments.
- **`required`**: Only encrypted SMB 3.x clients can connect. SMB 2.x clients are rejected at NEGOTIATE. **Recommended for production** with sensitive data.

**Per-session vs per-share encryption:**

- **Per-session**: When encryption is `preferred` or `required`, all traffic on an SMB 3.x session is encrypted after SESSION_SETUP completes.
- **Per-share**: Individual shares can require encryption via the `encrypt_data` flag. Unencrypted sessions accessing an encrypted share receive `STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED`.

**Security recommendation:** Set `encryption_mode: required` for environments handling sensitive data. This eliminates unencrypted traffic and rejects legacy clients that cannot encrypt.

### SMB3 Signing

SMB3 introduces stronger signing algorithms based on AES, replacing the HMAC-SHA256 signing used in SMB 2.x.

**Signing algorithms:**

| Algorithm | Dialect | Strength | Notes |
|-----------|---------|----------|-------|
| HMAC-SHA256 | SMB 2.x | 128-bit equivalent | Legacy, uses session key directly |
| AES-128-CMAC | SMB 3.0+ | 128-bit | Uses SP800-108 derived signing key |
| AES-128-GMAC | SMB 3.1.1 | 128-bit | Preferred; leverages GCM hardware acceleration |

**Algorithm negotiation (3.1.1):** During NEGOTIATE, the SMB2_SIGNING_CAPABILITIES context allows client and server to agree on a signing algorithm. DittoFS prefers GMAC > CMAC. Clients omitting the signing capability context default to AES-128-CMAC.

**When signing is active:** After SESSION_SETUP completes successfully (non-guest sessions), all messages are signed. Signing is redundant when encryption is active (AEAD provides integrity), but DittoFS signs encrypted messages to match Windows Server behavior and ensure compatibility.

**Security recommendation:** Set `signing.required: true` for all production deployments. This prevents message tampering even when encryption is not used.

### SPNEGO/Kerberos Authentication

SMB3 Kerberos authentication follows the SPNEGO protocol during SESSION_SETUP:

1. **Server advertises** both Kerberos (OID 1.2.840.113554.1.2.2) and NTLM mechanism OIDs
2. **Client with valid TGT** sends AP-REQ inside SPNEGO InitToken
3. **Server validates** AP-REQ against its keytab (shared with NFS adapter)
4. **Mutual authentication**: Server sends AP-REP proving its identity
5. **Session key** from Kerberos ticket is used as input to SP800-108 KDF

**Mutual authentication** is a critical security property: the AP-REP proves the server possesses the keytab, preventing impersonation. NTLM does not provide mutual authentication.

**Principal mapping**: The client Kerberos principal (without realm) is mapped to a DittoFS control plane user. The SMB adapter automatically derives the `cifs/` service principal from the configured `nfs/` principal.

### Preauth Integrity (Downgrade Protection)

SMB 3.1.1 introduces preauth integrity -- a running SHA-512 hash computed over the raw bytes of NEGOTIATE and SESSION_SETUP messages:

```
PreauthHash = SHA-512(Salt || NEG_REQ || NEG_RESP || SESS_SETUP_REQ || ...)
```

This hash serves as the **KDF context** for key derivation. Any man-in-the-middle modification of negotiate messages (e.g., stripping encryption capability) produces different derived keys, causing SESSION_SETUP to fail.

For SMB 3.0/3.0.2 (which lack preauth integrity), **FSCTL_VALIDATE_NEGOTIATE_INFO** provides downgrade detection. The client sends its original negotiate parameters; if the server's stored state doesn't match, the connection is dropped.

### Key Derivation

SMB3 derives per-purpose cryptographic keys from the session key using NIST SP800-108 Counter Mode KDF with HMAC-SHA256:

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| SigningKey | AES-CMAC/GMAC message signing |
| EncryptionKey | Server-to-client AES-GCM/CCM encryption |
| DecryptionKey | Client-to-server AES-GCM/CCM decryption |
| ApplicationKey | Application-level cryptographic operations |

**Dialect-specific contexts:**
- **SMB 3.0/3.0.2**: Fixed label/context strings (e.g., `"SmbSign\0"`, `"ServerIn \0"`)
- **SMB 3.1.1**: Preauth integrity hash as context (binds keys to exact negotiate exchange)

### Guest Sessions and NTLM Fallback

**Guest sessions** have significant security limitations:
- No session key is available, so **no signing** and **no encryption** are possible
- Guest sessions should be restricted to read-only access on public shares
- DittoFS never encrypts guest sessions, even in `required` mode (the connection is rejected instead)

**NTLM fallback** occurs when:
- Kerberos keytab is not configured
- Client has no valid Kerberos TGT
- DNS resolution prevents Kerberos service ticket acquisition

**NTLM security tradeoffs:**
- No mutual authentication (client cannot verify server identity)
- Vulnerable to relay attacks without channel binding
- Session key derived from password hash (weaker than Kerberos session key)
- Signing uses HMAC-SHA256 (weaker than AES-CMAC/GMAC)

**Security recommendation:** Configure Kerberos for all production deployments. Use NTLM only as a transition mechanism.

### Transport Security Comparison

| Property | SMB3 Encryption | NFS Kerberos (krb5p) |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Confidentiality | AES-128-GCM / AES-128-CCM | AES-256 wrap (per RFC 3962) |
| Integrity | AEAD tag (built into cipher) | Kerberos checksum |
| Key derivation | SP800-108 from session key | Kerberos sub-session key |
| Per-message overhead | 52 bytes (transform header) | ~28 bytes (GSS wrap token) |
| Downgrade protection | Preauth integrity hash (3.1.1) | GSS-API mechanism negotiation |
| Mutual auth | Via Kerberos AP-REP | Built into RPCSEC_GSS |
| Hardware acceleration | AES-NI + CLMUL (GCM) | Depends on krb5 library |

Both protocols provide strong transport security when properly configured. SMB3 encryption has the advantage of being built into the protocol (no external VPN needed), while NFS krb5p requires a functioning Kerberos infrastructure.

## Message Integrity

### SMB Message Signing

DittoFS supports SMB2 message signing using HMAC-SHA256, providing integrity protection against man-in-the-middle attacks and message tampering.

Signing behavior is configurable per the MS-SMB2 specification:

- **Enabled** (default: `true`): The server advertises signing capability during NEGOTIATE by setting `SMB2_NEGOTIATE_SIGNING_ENABLED`.
- **Required** (default: `false`): When set to `true`, the server sets `SMB2_NEGOTIATE_SIGNING_REQUIRED` and rejects unsigned messages from established sessions.

For production deployments, set `required: true` to enforce signing on all sessions.

Signing is configured via the control plane when creating or updating the SMB adapter:

```bash
./dfsctl adapter create --type smb --config '{
  "signing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "required": true
  }
}'
```

## Access Control

### NFSv4 ACLs

DittoFS supports NFSv4 ACL-based access control, providing fine-grained permission management beyond traditional POSIX owner/group/other modes. NFSv4 ACLs allow:

- Per-user and per-group access control entries (ACEs)
- Explicit ALLOW and DENY entries with defined ordering
- Granular permission bits (read data, write data, append, execute, delete, read attributes, write attributes, read ACL, write ACL, etc.)
- Inheritance flags for directories (propagation to new files and subdirectories)

ACLs are enforced at the metadata layer and evaluated in order: DENY entries take precedence when encountered before a matching ALLOW entry, following the NFSv4 specification.

### POSIX File Permissions

Traditional Unix file permissions are enforced at the metadata layer:

```go
// Enforced at metadata layer
func (m *MetadataStore) CheckAccess(handle FileHandle, authCtx *AuthContext) error {
    attr := m.GetFile(handle)

    // Check owner
    if attr.UID == authCtx.UID {
        // Check owner permissions
    }

    // Check group
    if attr.GID == authCtx.GID {
        // Check group permissions
    }

    // Check other permissions
}
```

When both NFSv4 ACLs and POSIX permissions are present, the ACL takes precedence for NFSv4 operations.

### Export-Level Access Control

```yaml
shares:
  - name: /export
    # IP-based access control
    allowed_clients:
      - 192.168.1.0/24
    denied_clients:
      - 192.168.1.50

    # Authentication requirements
    require_auth: true
    allowed_auth_methods: [unix, krb5]
```

### IP-Based Restrictions

**Allow specific networks:**
```yaml
shares:
  - name: /export
    allowed_clients:
      - 192.168.1.0/24  # Local network
      - 10.0.0.0/8       # Private network
```

**Deny specific hosts:**
```yaml
shares:
  - name: /export
    denied_clients:
      - 192.168.1.100   # Block specific IP
```

### Identity Mapping

**All Squash (map all users to anonymous):**
```yaml
shares:
  - name: /export
    identity_mapping:
      map_all_to_anonymous: true
      anonymous_uid: 65534  # nobody
      anonymous_gid: 65534  # nogroup
```

**Root Squash (map root to anonymous):**
```yaml
shares:
  - name: /export
    identity_mapping:
      map_privileged_to_anonymous: true  # root becomes nobody
      anonymous_uid: 65534
      anonymous_gid: 65534
```

**No Squashing (trust client UIDs):**
```yaml
shares:
  - name: /export
    identity_mapping:
      map_all_to_anonymous: false
      map_privileged_to_anonymous: false
```

**Warning**: No squashing trusts client-provided UIDs completely. Only use on trusted networks or when Kerberos authentication is enforced.

### Read-Only Shares

**Prevent all writes:**
```yaml
shares:
  - name: /export
    read_only: true  # All write operations will fail
```

## Network Security

### Encryption in Transit

DittoFS does not currently provide built-in TLS encryption for NFS or SMB wire traffic. While Kerberos provides authentication and message integrity, file data is transmitted in cleartext over TCP unless network-level encryption is used.

**Implications:**
- File data can be intercepted without network-level encryption
- Use VPN, IPsec, or WireGuard to protect data in transit
- SMB message signing protects integrity but not confidentiality

### Network-Level Protection

**Use VPN or encrypted tunnels:**

1. **WireGuard (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   # Set up WireGuard VPN between client and server
   # Then mount over the VPN interface
   sudo mount -t nfs -o nfsvers=4,tcp,port=2049 10.0.0.1:/export /mnt/test
   ```

2. **IPsec:**
   ```bash
   # Configure IPsec tunnel between client and server
   # NFS traffic flows through encrypted tunnel
   ```

3. **SSH Tunnel:**
   ```bash
   # Forward NFS port through SSH
   ssh -L 12049:localhost:12049 user@server

   # Mount through tunnel
   sudo mount -t nfs -o nfsvers=4,tcp,port=12049 localhost:/export /mnt/test
   ```

### Firewall Configuration

**Restrict access to DittoFS ports:**

```bash
# Linux (iptables)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 12049 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 12049 -j DROP

# Linux (firewalld)
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.1.0/24" port protocol="tcp" port="12049" accept'
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# macOS (pf)
# Add to /etc/pf.conf:
# pass in proto tcp from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 12049
# block in proto tcp from any to any port 12049
sudo pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf
```

## Kerberos Configuration

DittoFS uses a shared Kerberos layer (`pkg/auth/kerberos`) that serves both the NFS (RPCSEC_GSS) and SMB (SPNEGO) adapters. Configure Kerberos once and both protocols benefit.

### Server Configuration

Add the `kerberos` section to your DittoFS configuration file:

```yaml
kerberos:
  enabled: true
  keytab_path: /etc/dittofs/dittofs.keytab
  service_principal: nfs/server.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
  krb5_conf: /etc/krb5.conf
  max_clock_skew: 5m
  context_ttl: 8h
```

Configuration fields:

| Field | Description | Default |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `enabled` | Enable Kerberos authentication | `false` |
| `keytab_path` | Path to the Kerberos keytab file | (required when enabled) |
| `service_principal` | Service principal name (SPN) in `service/hostname@REALM` format | (required when enabled) |
| `krb5_conf` | Path to `krb5.conf` | `/etc/krb5.conf` |
| `max_clock_skew` | Maximum allowed clock difference between client and server | `5m` |
| `context_ttl` | Maximum lifetime of an RPCSEC_GSS security context | `8h` |

### Keytab Management

The keytab file contains the service principal's cryptographic key. It must be:

- Readable only by the DittoFS process user
- Stored securely with restricted file permissions (`chmod 600`)
- Rotated periodically according to your organization's security policy

DittoFS supports hot-reload of the keytab file. When the keytab is replaced on disk, the server picks up the new key without requiring a restart.

**Create a keytab (example with MIT Kerberos):**
```bash
# On the KDC or using kadmin
kadmin -q "addprinc -randkey nfs/server.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM"
kadmin -q "ktadd -k /etc/dittofs/dittofs.keytab nfs/server.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM"

# Set appropriate permissions
chmod 600 /etc/dittofs/dittofs.keytab
chown dittofs:dittofs /etc/dittofs/dittofs.keytab
```

### Environment Variable Overrides

Kerberos configuration can be overridden with environment variables, which is useful for container deployments and CI/CD pipelines:

| Environment Variable | Config Field | Notes |
|---------------------|--------------|-------|
| `DITTOFS_KERBEROS_KEYTAB` | `keytab_path` | Primary override |
| `DITTOFS_KERBEROS_KEYTAB_PATH` | `keytab_path` | Compatibility alias |
| `DITTOFS_KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL` | `service_principal` | Primary override |
| `DITTOFS_KERBEROS_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL` | `service_principal` | Compatibility alias |

### NFS Client Configuration

Mount with Kerberos authentication:

```bash
# Mount with Kerberos (krb5 security flavor)
sudo mount -t nfs -o sec=krb5,nfsvers=4,tcp,port=2049 server.example.com:/export /mnt/secure

# Verify the mount is using Kerberos
mount | grep /mnt/secure
```

Ensure the client has a valid Kerberos ticket:
```bash
kinit user@EXAMPLE.COM
klist
```

### SMB Client Configuration

SMB clients that support Kerberos (Windows, smbclient, CIFS kernel module) will automatically negotiate Kerberos via SPNEGO during session setup when the client has a valid ticket-granting ticket (TGT).

```bash
# Linux: mount with Kerberos
sudo mount -t cifs -o sec=krb5,vers=3.0 //server.example.com/export /mnt/secure

# smbclient with Kerberos
smbclient -k //server.example.com/export
```

## Remaining Limitations

- **No formal security audit**: The codebase has not been reviewed by a third-party security firm
- **No built-in TLS**: Wire-level encryption requires network-level solutions (VPN, IPsec)
- **No encryption at rest**: Content stores do not encrypt data (S3 server-side encryption can be used independently)
- **No audit logging**: File operation audit trail is not yet implemented
- **AUTH_UNIX trust model**: When Kerberos is not enabled, NFS AUTH_UNIX trusts client-provided UIDs

## Planned Security Features

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Use Strong Authentication

- Enable Kerberos for all NFS and SMB clients
- Avoid AUTH_UNIX and AUTH_NULL in untrusted environments
- Enforce SMB message signing to prevent tampering
- Rotate keytabs on a regular schedule

### 2. Network Isolation

- Deploy DittoFS in isolated network segments
- Use VLANs to separate storage traffic
- Implement network segmentation
- Use VPN or IPsec for encryption in transit

### 3. Minimal Permissions

- Use least-privilege principle
- Configure NFSv4 ACLs with explicit DENY entries where needed
- Enable root squash on all exports
- Use read-only exports when possible

### 4. Monitoring

- Enable Prometheus metrics collection
- Monitor failed authentication attempts
- Alert on unusual access patterns
- Track file access patterns

### 5. Regular Updates

- Keep DittoFS updated
- Monitor security advisories
- Apply patches promptly

### 6. Defense in Depth

Do not rely on a single security measure:
- Kerberos authentication
- SMB3 encryption (AES-GCM/CCM)
- SMB message signing (AES-CMAC/GMAC)
- Network encryption for NFS (VPN/IPsec)
- IP-based access control
- NFSv4 ACLs and POSIX permissions
- Identity mapping (root squash)
- Monitoring and alerting
- Regular audits
