## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v3.8: Business logic (leases, durable handles, state) in metadata service layer, not SMB internal package
- v3.8: SMB internal package = protocol encoding/decoding/framing only
- v3.8: Reuse NFSv4 infrastructure (delegations, state management, Kerberos) for SMB3
- v3.8: Shared Kerberos layer for SMB3 via existing RPCSEC_GSS infrastructure
- v3.8: Dependency order — negotiate -> KDF/signing -> encryption -> Kerberos -> leases -> durable handles -> cross-protocol -> testing
- 4 TODO(plan-03) cross-protocol oplock break markers from v3.5 (to resolve in v3.8)
- REF-01.8/REF-01.9 adapter translation layers deferred to v3.8
- 33-01: smbenc uses buffer-based pattern with error accumulation (not streaming io.Reader)
- 33-01: ConnectionCryptoState placed in internal/adapter/smb to avoid circular imports
- 33-01: CryptoState created eagerly for all connections (minimal overhead, simpler code path)
- 33-02: CryptoState interface in handlers/ to break circular imports with smb/ package
- 33-02: Dispatch hooks pattern (before/after per command) for cross-cutting concerns like preauth hash
- 33-02: Server cipher preference: AES-128-GCM > AES-128-CCM > AES-256-GCM > AES-256-CCM
- 33-02: DropConnection on HandlerResult for fatal protocol violations requiring TCP close
- 33-03: Map-based IOCTL dispatch table (IOCTLHandler func type) mirrors command dispatch pattern
- 33-03: VALIDATE_NEGOTIATE_INFO reads all 4 fields from CryptoState, never re-computes
- 33-03: 3.1.1 connections drop TCP on VNEG per MS-SMB2 3.3.5.15.12
- 33-03: All SMB handler binary encoding goes through smbenc codec (ARCH-02 enforced)
- [Phase 34]: CMAC in signing/ package (not standalone cmac/) for cohesion with other signers
- [Phase 34]: SessionSigningState kept temporarily with Signer + legacy SigningKey for minimal blast radius
- [Phase 34]: Signer interface pattern: Sign([16]byte) + Verify(bool) for polymorphic SMB signing
- [Phase 34-02]: SessionCryptoState holds all 4 keys upfront (even encryption/decryption for Phase 35)
- [Phase 34-02]: DeriveAllKeys dispatches by dialect: <3.0 direct HMAC, >=3.0 full KDF
- [Phase 34-02]: Default signing preference: GMAC > CMAC > HMAC-SHA256 (configurable via adapter settings)
- [Phase 34-02]: 3.1.1 clients omitting SIGNING_CAPABILITIES default to AES-128-CMAC per spec
- [Phase 35-01]: Vendored CCM from pion/dtls (MIT) to avoid 50+ transitive dependencies
- [Phase 35-01]: Encryptor interface: Encrypt(plaintext, aad) -> (nonce, ciphertext, err) mirrors Signer pattern
- [Phase 35-01]: Default cipher preference: AES-256-GCM > AES-256-CCM > AES-128-GCM > AES-128-CCM (256-bit first)
- [Phase 35-02]: EncryptWithNonce added to Encryptor interface (nonce-before-AAD requirement)
- [Phase 35-02]: EncryptableSession interface decouples middleware from session.Session (no circular imports)
- [Phase 35-02]: Encrypted sessions bypass signing entirely per MS-SMB2 3.3.4.1.1 (AEAD provides integrity)
- [Phase 35-02]: Consecutive decryption failures tracked per-connection (5 failures = disconnect)
- [Phase 35-03]: EncryptionConfig struct duplicated in handlers/ to avoid circular imports (mirrors SigningConfig pattern)
- [Phase 35-03]: shouldRejectUnencryptedTreeConnect only enforces in required mode (preferred allows mixed)
- [Phase 35-03]: Live SMB settings can upgrade encryption_mode from disabled to preferred at runtime
- [Phase 35-03]: buildAuthenticatedResponse takes encryptData bool for SessionFlagEncryptData
- [Phase 36-01]: BuildMutualAuth returns raw AP-REP (APPLICATION 15), not GSS-wrapped; protocol adapters add their own framing
- [Phase 36-01]: ReplayCache keyed by 4-tuple (principal, ctime, cusec, servicePrincipal) for cross-protocol dedup
- [Phase 36-01]: HasSubkey exported as package-level function for reuse by NFS GSS and SMB auth
- [Phase 36-01]: Shared auth service pattern: protocol-agnostic core in internal/auth/, protocol framing in adapter packages
- [Phase 36-02]: Session key normalized to 16 bytes via copy() (truncate >16, zero-pad <16) per MS-SMB2 3.3.5.5.3
- [Phase 36-02]: MIC computation uses key usage 23 (acceptor sign); verification uses 25 (initiator sign) per RFC 4121
- [Phase 36-02]: Client Kerberos OID echoed in SPNEGO response (MS OID preferred for Windows SSPI)
- [Phase 36-02]: Valid Kerberos ticket from unknown principal = hard failure (not guest), security decision
- [Phase 36-02]: Server mechListMIC uses full session key (not normalized 16-byte key) per RFC 4178
- [Phase 36-03]: Kerberos failure returns SPNEGO reject (NegState=reject) so client retries with fresh SessionId=0 for NTLM
- [Phase 36-03]: Guest sessions gated by GuestEnabled AND signing.required (no session key = no signing)
- [Phase 36-03]: NEGOTIATE SecurityBuffer contains SPNEGO NegTokenInit advertising available auth mechanisms
- [Phase 36-03]: NTLM disable check early in SessionSetup, before message type dispatch
- [Phase 36-03]: SetKerberosProvider auto-creates KerberosService and IdentityConfig (strip-realm default)
- [Phase 37-01]: advanceEpoch helper centralizes all epoch increments for monotonicity
- [Phase 37-01]: Recently-broken cache uses 5s TTL to prevent directory lease grant-break storms
- [Phase 37-01]: Cross-key conflicts break to LeaseStateNone (simplest correct behavior per MS-SMB2)
- [Phase 37-01]: Lease upgrade whitelist: R->RW, R->RH, R->RWH, RH->RWH, RW->RWH
- [Phase 37-02]: LockManagerResolver interface pattern for per-share LockManager resolution at request time
- [Phase 37-02]: metadataServiceResolver bridges MetadataService to lease package (uses DecodeFileHandle)
- [Phase 37-02]: Surviving oplock wire-format types moved to oplock_constants.go (CREATE response uses OplockLevel)
- [Phase 37-02]: Traditional oplock code paths fully removed (not just disabled)
- [Phase 37-03]: Auto-wire LockManager as DirChangeNotifier in RegisterStoreForShare
- [Phase 37-03]: ctx.ClientAddr used as originClientID (AuthContext has no Identity.ClientID)
- [Phase 37-03]: setattr retains direct NotifyDirChange (NFS4-specific, not in DirChangeType enum)
- [Phase 37-03]: NFS4 delegation recall for removed dirs kept as direct StateManager call (cleanup, not notification)
- [Phase 38-01]: DurableHandleStore follows ClientRegistrationStore sub-interface pattern exactly
- [Phase 38-01]: Memory store uses linear scans for secondary lookups (acceptable for low handle counts)
- [Phase 38-01]: BadgerDB uses hex-encoded composite keys for multi-value indices (dh:appid:{hex}:{id})
- [Phase 38-01]: PostgreSQL uses SQL interval arithmetic for server-side expired handle cleanup
- [Phase 38-01]: Optional [16]byte fields stored as NULL in PostgreSQL when zero-value
- [Phase 38-02]: V2 (DH2Q) takes precedence over V1 (DHnQ) when both present per MS-SMB2
- [Phase 38-02]: V1 requires batch oplock for grant; V2 has no oplock requirement
- [Phase 38-02]: Reconnect early-exit at Step 4b in CREATE handler avoids unnecessary file operations
- [Phase 38-02]: Session key hash = SHA-256 of session signing key for reconnect security
- [Phase 38-02]: DurableTimeoutMs defaults to 60000ms (60 seconds) in handler constructor
- [Phase 38-02]: IsDurable NOT set on restored handle -- client must re-request after reconnect
- [Phase 38-03]: Scavenger iterates all handles client-side (not bulk delete) to perform cleanup before deletion
- [Phase 38-03]: Local durableHandleStoreProvider interface avoids importing storetest from production code
- [Phase 38-03]: Scavenger lifecycle tied to Serve context -- stops automatically on adapter shutdown
- [Phase 39]: Delegation struct has zero NFS-specific types (no Stateid4, no *time.Timer) - NFS adapter maps between its own types and shared Delegation
- [Phase 39]: Read delegation + Read-only lease coexist; Write delegation conflicts with any lease
- [Phase 39]: Old CheckAndBreakOpLocksFor* methods delegate to new CheckAndBreakCachingFor* for backward compatibility
- [Phase 39]: DelegationRecallTimeout defaults to 90s (longer than SMB 35s, matching NFS conventions)
- [Phase 39-02]: NFSBreakHandler registered per-share (same pattern as SMBBreakHandler), not on single global LockManager
- [Phase 39-02]: delegStateidMap bridges LockManager DelegationID (UUID) to NFS Stateid4 for wire-format lookup
- [Phase 39-02]: breakDelegations marks recentlyBroken cache for unified anti-storm across protocols
- [Phase 39-02]: Mutex release before LockManager calls: capture refs under lock, release, then call LockManager (Pitfall 2)
- [Phase 39-03]: docs/SMB.md expanded in-place (1487 lines) covering all v3.8 features with both operational and wire-format details
- [Phase 40-02]: Tests for implemented features removed from KNOWN_FAILURES, tracked as fix candidates in baseline-results.md
- [Phase 40-02]: Removed entries use bullet-list format (not table) to prevent parse-results.sh from masking failures
- [Phase 40-02]: Baseline measurement deferred to x86_64 Linux CI (WPTS container is linux/amd64 only)
- [Phase 40-03]: CLIRunner in SMB3TestEnv (not apiclient.Client) to match existing E2E helper conventions
- [Phase 40-03]: go-smb2 encryption/signing tested via data integrity verification (library handles crypto transparently)
- [Phase 40-04]: Mount-based file ops for lease tests (mount.cifs handles lease negotiation transparently at kernel level)
- [Phase 40-04]: 10 goroutines (5 NFS + 5 SMB) with 3 iterations for concurrent conflict testing
- [Phase 40-04]: Kerberos tests skip gracefully on platforms without mount.cifs or KDC support
- [Phase 40-01]: 119 fix candidate failures excluded from KNOWN_FAILURES (implemented features that still fail)
- [Phase 40-01]: 252 individual test entries replace all wildcard patterns in KNOWN_FAILURES
- [Phase 40-01]: Directory leases (dirlease) categorized as unimplemented, separate from file leases (Phase 37)
- [Phase 40-06]: Multi-OS client compat CI NOT on PRs (too slow); weekly + push + manual dispatch only
- [Phase 40-06]: smbtorture Kerberos uses SMBTORTURE_AUTH env var or --kerberos flag (added in 40-05)
- [Phase 40-06]: CI tiered: PR (<5min) < push (<30min) < weekly (<60min full matrix)
- [Phase 40]: Lease response context tag must be RqLs (not RsLs) per MS-SMB2 2.2.14.2.10
- [Phase 40]: V1/V2 lease encoding determined by request data length (< 52 bytes = V1), not epoch value
