# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-15)

**Core value:** Enable enterprise-grade multi-protocol file access with unified locking, Kerberos auth, and immediate cross-protocol visibility
**Current focus:** Phase 07 — testing-hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 07
Plan: Not started
Phase: 07 (testing-hardening) — PLANNED, ready to execute (4 plans: 07-01..07-04)
Last activity: 2026-04-18

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Historical decisions archived in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v0.13.0 decisions:**

- Reset phase numbering to 1 for v0.13.0 (previous v0.10.0 phase directories archived under `.planning/milestones/v0.10.0-phases/`)
- Fine granularity (from config.json) — 7 phases preserving natural boundaries: foundations, per-engine drivers, destinations, scheduler/retention, restore orchestration, API surface, testing
- Metadata-only scope; block data backup explicitly out of scope
- Destination drivers live in a new `pkg/backup/destination/` package separate from `pkg/blockstore/remote/` (different semantics: immutable archives vs block-addressable chunks) but share AWS client plumbing
- Manifest v1 ships with `payload_id_set` field from day one for forward-compat with block-GC hold (SAFETY-01)
- Restore precondition is share-disabled (REST-02) — shares must be manually disabled before restore; restore returns 409 Conflict otherwise
- Retention is a separate post-upload pass, never races with in-flight backup (SCHED-06)
- `robfig/cron/v3` is the only new direct dependency
- [Phase 05]: Defined narrow shares.ShareStore interface locally (GetShare + UpdateShare only) to avoid runtime→store import cycle
- [Phase 05]: Share.Enabled GORM tag = 'default:true;not null'; post-AutoMigrate backfill covers SQLite ADD-COLUMN dialect
- [Phase 05]: Engine-persistent store_id: Badger uses cfg:store_id key, Postgres uses server_config.store_id column (migration 000008), Memory uses struct field populated on construction; all return ULID via GetStoreID()
- [Phase 05]: target.go DefaultResolver.Resolve returns engine-persistent GetStoreID() instead of volatile cfg.ID — D-06 cross-store contamination gate now meaningful
- [Phase 05-restore-orchestration-safety-rails]: GetManifestOnly returns parsed *manifest.Manifest directly (not raw bytes) — all callers need the parsed form, drivers already parse internally
- [Phase 05-restore-orchestration-safety-rails]: S3 GetBackup delegates manifest prologue to GetManifestOnly — shared error shape, no code duplication
- [Phase 05-restore-orchestration-safety-rails]: Plan 04: Postgres schema-scoped open deferred to Plan 06 — Plan 04 ships the signature + dispatch with a clear deferred-construction error for postgres; Plan 06 wires the real search_path construction
- [Phase 05-restore-orchestration-safety-rails]: Plan 04: ListPostgresRestoreOrphans is REQUIRED (non-optional) — non-Postgres stores produce a clear error rather than silent empty slice, so crash-interrupted restore orphans cannot accumulate undetected
- [Phase 05-restore-orchestration-safety-rails]: Plan 04: Postgres schema orphan CreatedAt derived from embedded ULID timestamp (Option A) rather than pg_stat_file (Option B) — portable, zero extra DB metadata required
- [Phase 05]: Use atomic.Pointer[[8]byte] for serverBootVerifier — lock-free hot-path reads, safe cold-path bump from RunRestore
- [Phase 05]: Plan 06: JobStore interface uses GetBackupRecord (not GetBackupRecordByID) to match real GORMStore method name; Plan 07 can compose without adapters.
- [Phase 05]: Plan 06: RenamePostgresSchema implemented as interface-assertion extension point in CommitSwap; concrete impl deferred to Plan 07 (recommended) or orphan sweep fallback.
- [Phase 05]: Plan 06: Terminal-state UpdateBackupJob uses context.Background() so SAFETY-02 row lands even after parent ctx cancellation.
- [Phase 05]: Plan 05-07: Phase-5 sentinels canonical in pkg/backup/restore (not storebackups) to avoid import cycle
- [Phase 05]: Plan 05-07: RestoreResolver extends StoreResolver (ResolveWithName + ResolveCfg) — backward-compat preserved
- [Phase 05]: Plan 05-07: SetRestoreBumpBootVerifier post-construction setter on runtime.Runtime avoids adapter→runtime import cycle
- [Phase 05]: Plan 08: block-GC hold uses at-GC-time manifest union; no persisted hold table (D-11)
- [Phase 05]: Plan 08: provider errors fail-open (under-hold) rather than abort GC
- [Phase 05]: Plan 09: Shipped MetricsCollector + Tracer interfaces with Noop defaults and OTel concrete; deferred PromMetrics concrete because prometheus/client_golang not in go.mod and Phase 5 forbids new top-level deps.
- [Phase 05]: Plan 09: Propagate share.Enabled from DB model to runtime ShareConfig in init.go (Rule 3 auto-fix) — without this, production upgrades would load all shares as Enabled=false and adapter gates would refuse everything.
- [Phase 05]: Runtime.RunBlockGC production entrypoint closes SAFETY-01 — refuses without BackupHold wiring; dedups distinct remotes by configID via shares.Service.DistinctRemoteStores

### Pending Todos

- After Wave 4 merges: run `code-simplifier` + `code-reviewer` agents on full phase 06 diff, then open PR to `develop`.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
