## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Historical decisions archived in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v0.13.0 decisions:**

- Reset phase numbering to 1 for v0.13.0 (previous v0.10.0 phase directories archived under `.planning/milestones/v0.10.0-phases/`)
- Fine granularity (from config.json) — 7 phases preserving natural boundaries: foundations, per-engine drivers, destinations, scheduler/retention, restore orchestration, API surface, testing
- Metadata-only scope; block data backup explicitly out of scope
- Destination drivers live in a new `pkg/backup/destination/` package separate from `pkg/blockstore/remote/` (different semantics: immutable archives vs block-addressable chunks) but share AWS client plumbing
- Manifest v1 ships with `payload_id_set` field from day one for forward-compat with block-GC hold (SAFETY-01)
- Restore precondition is share-disabled (REST-02) — shares must be manually disabled before restore; restore returns 409 Conflict otherwise
- Retention is a separate post-upload pass, never races with in-flight backup (SCHED-06)
- `robfig/cron/v3` is the only new direct dependency

### Pending Todos

- Run `/gsd-plan-phase 1` to decompose Phase 1 (Foundations) into executable plans.

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
