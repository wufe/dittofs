# Project Milestones: DittoFS NFS Protocol Evolution

## v4.7 Offline/Edge Resilience (Shipped: 2026-03-20)

**Delivered:** Offline/edge resilience for DittoFS — per-share cache retention policies, S3 health monitoring with circuit breaker, offline read/write paths, and protocol correctness fixes.

**Phases completed:** 63-68 (4 phases, 10 plans)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Per-share cache retention policies (pin/ttl/lru) with REST API and CLI support
- S3 health monitor with 3-failure threshold, exponential backoff, and automatic recovery
- Syncer circuit breaker — pauses uploads during outage, resumes oldest-first on recovery
- Offline read path — serves locally cached blocks when S3 unreachable, clear errors for remote-only blocks
- Offline write path — accepts writes to local store during S3 outage, queues for sync on reconnect
- Health observability via `/health` endpoint, `dfs status`, and `dfsctl status` with per-share health
- NTLM challenge flag cleanup — removed unimplemented Flag128/Flag56/FlagSeal capabilities
- Share hot-reload integration tests — OnShareChange callback lifecycle verification

**Stats:**

- 4 phases, 10 plans
- 9 PRs merged (#278-#287)
- 289,608 LOC Go
- Mar 15 - Mar 20, 2026 (6 days)

**Known gaps:**

- INFRA-01 through INFRA-04: delivered via PR #286 outside GSD — no formal VERIFICATION.md

## v4.0 BlockStore Unification Refactor (Shipped: 2026-03-11)

- Restructured into clean `pkg/blockstore/` hierarchy (local/fs, local/memory, remote/s3, remote/memory, engine, sync, gc, io)
- Implemented per-share BlockStore lifecycle with ref-counted shared remote stores and isolated local paths
- Built LRU read cache with copy-on-read semantics and adaptive sequential prefetcher
- Platform-aware auto-deduction (darwin sysctl, linux cgroup, windows GlobalMemoryStatusEx) for buffer/cache sizing
