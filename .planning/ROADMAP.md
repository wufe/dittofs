# Roadmap: DittoFS NFS Protocol Evolution

## Overview

DittoFS evolves from NFSv3 to full NFSv4.2 support across fifteen milestones. v1.0 builds the unified locking foundation (NLM + SMB leases), v2.0 adds NFSv4.0 stateful operations with Kerberos authentication, v3.0 introduces NFSv4.1 sessions for reliability and NAT-friendliness, v3.5 refactors the adapter layer and core for clean protocol separation, v3.6 achieves Windows SMB compatibility with proper ACL support, v3.8 upgrades the SMB implementation to SMB3.0/3.0.2/3.1.1 with encryption, signing, leases, Kerberos, and durable handles, v4.0 refactors the storage layer into a clean two-tier block store model (Local + Remote), v4.2 delivers benchmarking infrastructure, v4.3 fixes NFS/SMB protocol gaps, v4.7 adds offline/edge resilience with cache retention policies and disconnected operation, v0.10.0 hardens the system for production with share quotas, client tracking, trash/soft-delete, full SMB credit flow control, WPTS conformance fixes, and multi-channel session binding. Future milestones include block-level compression/encryption (v4.5), developer experience improvements (v4.8), and NFSv4.2 extensions (v5.0). Each milestone delivers complete, testable functionality.

## v0.10.0 Production Hardening + SMB Protocol Fixes

### Phase 69: SMB Protocol Foundation
**Goal**: macOS clients can mount DittoFS shares over SMB 3.1.1 with signing, and the server enforces MS-SMB2 credit flow control for all clients
**Depends on**: Phase 68 (v4.7 complete)
**Requirements**: SMB-01, SMB-02, SMB-03, SMB-04, SMB-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `mount_smbfs //user@host/share /mnt` succeeds on macOS without signature verification errors, and Windows 11 signing continues to work (no regression)
  2. Server rejects requests where CreditCharge is insufficient for the payload size (e.g., READ/WRITE > 64KB with CreditCharge=1 returns error)
  3. Every SMB response grants at least 1 credit; a client that sends valid requests never reaches zero credits and deadlocks
  4. Multi-credit I/O operations correctly validate CreditCharge = ceil(PayloadSize / 65536) before dispatching to handlers
  5. Compound requests account credits at the compound level and grant credits only in the final response of the compound
**Verification**: `go build ./...` && `go test ./...` && macOS mount_smbfs manual test && WPTS BVT regression check
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 69-01-PLAN.md — macOS signing fix (PR #288 absorb) + full MS-SMB2 signing audit
- [ ] 69-02-PLAN.md — CommandSequenceWindow + credit charge validation helpers + minimum grant enforcement
- [ ] 69-03-PLAN.md — Credit validation wiring into request pipeline + compound credit accounting

### Phase 70: Storage Observability and Quotas
**Goal**: Operators can see accurate storage consumption per share, and per-share quotas enforce size limits reported consistently via NFS and SMB
**Depends on**: Phase 69
**Requirements**: QUOTA-01, QUOTA-02, QUOTA-03, QUOTA-04, QUOTA-05, STATS-01, STATS-02, STATS-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `BlockStore.Stats()` returns non-zero UsedSize reflecting actual aggregate block sizes, with logical size (sum of file sizes) and physical size (block storage consumption) distinguished
  2. `dfsctl share create --quota-bytes 10GB` and `dfsctl share update --quota-bytes 50GB` persist per-share quota limits in the control plane; `dfsctl share list` displays quota and usage
  3. Write operations to a share at quota return NFS3ERR_NOSPC (NFSv3) / NFS4ERR_NOSPC (NFSv4) / STATUS_DISK_FULL (SMB) and refuse additional data
  4. NFSv3 FSSTAT and NFSv4 GETATTR(space_total/space_free/space_avail) report quota-adjusted values so `df` shows quota as total and (quota - used) as available
  5. SMB FileFsSizeInformation and FileFsFullSizeInformation return quota-aware sizes so Windows Explorer shows correct free space matching the NFS view
**Verification**: `go build ./...` && `go test ./...` && quota enforcement test with NFS + SMB clients && `df` on both protocols matches
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 70-01-PLAN.md — Data model foundation (QuotaBytes field, atomic usage counters, BlockStore.Stats() UsedSize)
- [ ] 70-02-PLAN.md — Quota enforcement and protocol reporting (PrepareWrite check, quota-aware FSSTAT, NFSv4 attrs, SMB cleanup)
- [ ] 70-03-PLAN.md — CLI/API quota management (--quota-bytes flags, share list columns, runtime wiring)

### Phase 71: Operational Visibility
**Goal**: Operators can see all connected NFS and SMB clients in a single unified view with connection metadata and automatic stale cleanup
**Depends on**: Phase 69
**Requirements**: CLIENT-01, CLIENT-02, CLIENT-03, CLIENT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Protocol-agnostic `ClientRecord` model in the runtime tracks client IP, protocol (NFS/SMB), connected-at timestamp, last-activity timestamp, mount points/tree connects, and authentication identity
  2. NFS and SMB adapters register clients on connect and deregister on disconnect via a shared `ClientRegistry` interface in the runtime
  3. `dfsctl client list` displays active clients in table format with columns for IP, protocol, user, share, and connected duration; `-o json` outputs JSON
  4. REST API endpoint `GET /api/clients` returns the list of active client records with protocol, IP, shares, and auth identity
  5. Stale client records are automatically removed via configurable TTL-based cleanup (default 5 minutes after last activity)
**Verification**: `go build ./...` && `go test ./...` && mount via NFS and SMB, then `dfsctl client list` shows both
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [x] 71-01-PLAN.md — ClientRecord model, Registry service, TTL sweeper, Runtime wiring
- [ ] 71-02-PLAN.md — NFS/SMB adapter integration, REST API, apiclient, CLI commands

### Phase 72: WPTS Conformance Push
**Goal**: WPTS known failure count reduced from 73 to approximately 40-45, primarily by implementing ChangeNotify and fixing negotiate/leasing edge cases
**Depends on**: Phase 69 (credit flow baseline stabilizes protocol compliance)
**Requirements**: WPTS-01, WPTS-02, WPTS-03, WPTS-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. SMB2 CHANGE_NOTIFY requests are accepted, held as pending async requests, and dispatched with FILE_NOTIFY_INFORMATION when files are created, removed, renamed, or modified in a watched directory; ~20 BVT ChangeNotify tests pass
  2. Negotiate and encryption edge cases fixed (preauth hash improvements cascade from Phase 69 macOS fix); ~5 additional tests pass
  3. Leasing and durable handle reconnect edge cases resolved (lease break state transitions, epoch tracking, DH V2 reconnect corner cases); ~4-6 additional tests pass
  4. WPTS known failure count is at or below 45 (reduced from 73), with zero new failures introduced (193+ passing tests maintained)
**Verification**: `go build ./...` && `go test ./...` && full WPTS suite run showing pass/known/new/skipped counts
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 73: SMB Conformance Deep-Dive
**Goal**: Systematic WPTS BVT and smbtorture conformance push -- clear all fixable expected failures, fix compound edge cases, timestamp freeze-thaw, and update documentation with accurate targets
**Depends on**: Phase 72 (WPTS conformance push baseline), Phase 69 (SMB protocol foundation)
**Requirements**: WPTS-01, WPTS-02, WPTS-03, WPTS-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. WPTS BVT known failures reduced to 56 (53 permanent + 3 expected timestamp tests deferred — require metadata-service-level directory timestamp propagation)
  2. smbtorture known failures reduced from ~492 to ~438 (exceeded ~460 target)
  3. ChangeNotify fully implemented with ADS stream, security, and close notifications
  4. Timestamp freeze-thaw with per-field tracking for all four timestamp fields (CreationTime, LastAccessTime, LastWriteTime, ChangeTime); 3 directory-level timestamp tests deferred
  5. Zero new failures in both WPTS and smbtorture (all fixed tests removed from known failures, no regressions)
  6. Compound edge cases deferred — no changes to compound.go needed for current test coverage
**Verification**: `go build ./...` && `go test ./...` && full WPTS suite run showing pass/known/new/skipped counts
**Plans**: 5 plans
Plans:
- [x] 73-01-PLAN.md -- WPTS ChangeNotify completion (ADS stream, ChangeSecurity, ServerReceiveSmb2Close)
- [x] 73-02-PLAN.md -- WPTS ADS share access + timestamp conformance

- [x] 73-05-PLAN.md -- Compound edge cases + freeze-thaw + documentation

### Phase 73.1: SMB Conformance Round 2 (INSERTED)
**Goal**: Fix ~50 smbtorture tests across compound (17), create (10), streams (13), notify (5), WPTS expected (5), and compound_async (10) categories. Focus on tractable fixes without deep protocol rearchitecture.
**Depends on**: Phase 73 (SMB conformance deep-dive baseline)
**Requirements**: WPTS-01, WPTS-02, WPTS-03, WPTS-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Compound request handling passes smbtorture: related/unrelated request chaining, error propagation, FileID substitution, 8-byte padding, interim responses
  2. CREATE edge cases fixed: leading slash path handling, mkdir visibility, create context blob validation, ACL-based create
  3. ADS/streams tests pass: attributes, create disposition, delete, I/O, rename, names enumeration, share modes
  4. ChangeNotify remaining tests pass: valid-req validation, handle permissions, overflow, session reconnect
  5. WPTS BVT expected failures reduced to 0: directory timestamp propagation (3) and ChangeNotify (2) fixed
**Verification**: `go build ./...` && `go test ./...` && full WPTS + smbtorture suite run showing pass/known/new counts
**Plans**: 4 plans
Plans:
- [x] 73.1-01-PLAN.md -- Compound request conformance (related/unrelated/invalid/interim/padding/find)
- [x] 73.1-02-PLAN.md -- CREATE edge cases + ADS/streams conformance
- [x] 73.1-03-PLAN.md -- ChangeNotify remaining + WPTS expected failures (timestamps + notify)
- [ ] 73.1-04-PLAN.md -- Compound async request handling

### Phase 74: SMB Multi-Channel
**Goal**: SMB clients can establish multiple TCP connections to the same session for aggregate bandwidth and fault tolerance, gated behind a configuration flag
**Depends on**: Phase 69 (SMB protocol foundation), Phase 72 (WPTS conformance stabilized)
**Requirements**: MCH-01, MCH-02, MCH-03, MCH-04, MCH-05, MCH-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Server advertises SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_MULTI_CHANNEL in NEGOTIATE response when multi-channel is enabled in configuration; FSCTL_QUERY_NETWORK_INTERFACE_INFO IOCTL returns available network interfaces
  2. SESSION_SETUP with SMB2_SESSION_FLAG_BINDING successfully binds a new TCP connection to an existing session, sharing tree connects, open files, and lease state
  3. Each channel derives its own signing key from the channel-specific preauth integrity hash, and signatures are validated per-channel
  4. Lease break notifications are sent to all active channels for a session; if one channel fails delivery, other channels still receive the break
  5. Connection cleanup checks session refcount before destroying session state (last channel close tears down session; earlier channel closes only remove that channel)
  6. Multi-channel is gated behind `adapters.smb.multichannel.enabled` config flag (default: false); when disabled, session binding requests are rejected
**Verification**: `go build ./...` && `go test ./...` && Windows multi-NIC client binds 2 channels && WPTS regression check
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 75: Manual Verification v0.10.0
**Goal**: End-to-end manual verification of all v0.10.0 features across macOS, Windows, and Linux clients
**Depends on**: Phase 74
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. macOS mount_smbfs with signing works without errors
  2. Share quota enforcement verified on both NFS (`df` shows quota) and SMB (Explorer shows correct free space)
  3. `dfsctl client list` shows active NFS and SMB clients with correct protocol, share, and user information
  4. WPTS suite confirms known failures at or below 45 with zero new failures
  5. Trash: delete via NFS, invisible in listing, visible via `dfsctl trash list`, restore works, expiry purges automatically
  6. Multi-channel (if enabled): Windows client binds second channel, I/O uses both connections
**Verification**: Manual testing checklist
**Plans**: TBD

**Goal**: Add AES-256-GCM encryption before remote store upload for zero-trust storage
**Depends on**: Phase 49.4
**Reference**: GitHub #186
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. EncryptedBlockStore decorator wraps any RemoteStore implementation
  2. Hybrid RSA + AES-256-GCM: per-block random symmetric keys
  3. Block format: [header: version + algo + RSA(key) + nonce] [AES-GCM ciphertext]
  4. Key file configurable per share, passphrase via environment variable
  5. Encryption composable with compression (compress then encrypt)
**Verification**: `go build ./...` && `go test ./...` && encryption round-trip test
**Plans**: TBD

  2. `make test-e2e` handles sudo and build tags automatically
  3. NFS CI workflow uses scoped path triggers (only runs on NFS-related changes)
  4. NFS CI uses tiered test matrix (fast unit tests first, slow E2E only on merge)
  5. CI runtime reduced by 30%+ compared to current configuration
**Verification**: `make test` && CI pipeline runs successfully
**Plans**: TBD
