# DittoFS NFS Protocol Evolution

## What This Is

A comprehensive multi-protocol virtual filesystem with NFSv3/NFSv4.0/NFSv4.1 and SMB3.1.1 support, Kerberos authentication, unified cross-protocol locking, and advanced features like delegations, leases, durable handles, and encryption. v1.0 (NLM + unified locking), v2.0 (NFSv4.0 + Kerberos), v3.0 (NFSv4.1 sessions), v3.5 (adapter/core refactoring), v3.6 (Windows compatibility), and v3.8 (SMB3 protocol upgrade) are shipped. Next: BlockStore unification refactor (v4.0), then NFSv4.2 features (v4.1), then benchmarking (v4.2).

Target: Cloud-native enterprise NAS with feature parity exceeding JuiceFS and Hammerspace, particularly in security (Kerberos + AES encryption), session reliability (EOS), cross-protocol consistency, and Windows SMB3.1.1 compatibility.

## Current Milestone: v4.0 BlockStore Unification Refactor

**Goal:** Replace the confusing layered storage architecture (pkg/cache, pkg/payload, pkg/payload/store, pkg/payload/offloader) with a clean two-tier block store model: Local (mandatory, per-share) and Remote (optional, per-share).

**Target outcomes:**
- Clean two-tier model: Local block store (FS/memory, mandatory) + Remote block store (S3/memory, optional)
- Per-share block store isolation (different local paths and remote backends per share)
- Block state machine: Dirty -> Local -> Uploading -> Remote
- Remove DirectWriteStore hack and FS payload store dead code
- New CLI: `dfsctl store block local/remote` replacing `dfsctl store payload`
- New DB model: BlockStoreConfig with kind discriminator replacing PayloadStoreConfig
- Package restructure: pkg/blockstore/ absorbing pkg/cache, pkg/payload, pkg/payload/store
- L1 read cache with sequential prefetch
- Auto-deduced defaults from CPU/memory

## Upcoming Milestone: v4.1 NFSv4.2 Extensions

**Goal:** Complete the NFS protocol suite with NFSv4.2 advanced features: server-side copy, clone/reflinks, sparse files, extended attributes, and I/O hints.

## Upcoming Milestone: v4.2 Benchmarking & Performance

**Goal:** Comprehensive benchmarking suite comparing DittoFS against competitors (JuiceFS, NFS-Ganesha, RClone, kernel NFS, Samba) to prove performance advantage of pure-Go, FUSE-less architecture, followed by iterative performance optimization.

**Tracking:** [GitHub #193](https://github.com/marmos91/dittofs/issues/193)

## Core Value

Enable enterprise-grade multi-protocol file access (NFSv3, NFSv4.x, SMB3) with unified locking, Kerberos authentication, and immediate cross-protocol visibility — all deployable in containerized Kubernetes environments with first-class Windows client support.

### Out of Scope

- pNFS (parallel NFS) — deferred until scale-out architecture needed
- Labeled NFS (SELinux labels) — not required for target use cases
- NFSv3 xattr workarounds — xattrs via NFSv4.2/SMB only
- Cross-server COPY_NOTIFY — single server focus
- Bundled KDC — external AD/KDC only
- NFS over RDMA — standard TCP sufficient
- NFSv2 — obsolete, no demand
- ACL enforcement in CheckAccess — deferred tech debt from v2.0 (POSIX permissions enforced instead)

## Context

**Current State (post-v3.8):**
- ~307,000 LOC Go (+44,956 lines in v3.8)
- NFSv3 + NFSv4.0 + NFSv4.1 + NLM + SMB3.1.1 fully implemented
- SMB3 security: AES encryption (128/256 GCM/CCM), AES signing (CMAC/GMAC), preauth integrity
- SMB3 features: Lease V2 with directory leasing, durable handles V1/V2, VALIDATE_NEGOTIATE_INFO
- SPNEGO/Kerberos authentication with automatic NTLM fallback and guest session support
- Cross-protocol coordination: SMB3 leases <-> NFS delegations bidirectional breaks
- Conformance testing: smbtorture baselines, WPTS BVT, go-smb2 E2E, multi-OS CI
- Windows 11 ARM64 verified: 10/10 manual verification tests passed over SMB 3.1.1
- K8s operator with portmapper support

**Known tech debt:**
- ACL enforcement in CheckAccess deferred (POSIX permissions enforced instead)
- Delegation Prometheus metrics not instrumented
- SACL is empty stub (requires audit logging infrastructure)
- Short name (8.3) generation deferred
- CHANGE_NOTIFY cleanup on disconnect deferred
- smbtorture full pass rate (infrastructure built, iterative improvement ongoing)

**Target Environment:**
- Kubernetes-first (containerized)
- No kernel modules or privileged access required
- External Active Directory for Kerberos
- Single-instance initially (multi-instance future)
- Windows 11 clients as primary SMB target

**Competitive Landscape:**
- JuiceFS: NFSv3 only, no v4, no Kerberos
- Hammerspace: NFSv3/v4/v4.1, limited v4.2, enterprise pricing
- DittoFS target: Full NFSv4.2 + Kerberos + cross-protocol locks + sessions + Windows ACLs

**Reference Implementations:**
- [Linux kernel fs/nfs](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/fs/nfs) — client
- [Linux kernel fs/nfsd](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/fs/nfsd) — server
- [nfs4j](https://github.com/dCache/nfs4j) — pure Java NFSv4.2
- [Microsoft WindowsProtocolTestSuites](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsProtocolTestSuites) — SMB2 conformance (MIT)
- [Samba smbtorture](https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Writing_Torture_Tests) — SMB protocol testing (GPL)

## Constraints

- **Code Location**: NFSv4 handlers in `internal/adapter/nfs/v4/`
- **Lock Manager**: Embedded in metadata service, not separate component
- **Lock Storage**: Same store as metadata (per-share)
- **Connection Pool**: Per-adapter (NFS pool, SMB pool), unified stateless/stateful
- **Kerberos**: External KDC only (Active Directory), AUTH_SYS fallback available
- **Testing**: TDD approach — E2E tests first, then implementation
- **Documentation**: Update `docs/` for all new features
- **Single Port**: NFSv4 uses port 2049 only (no mountd, NLM ports for v4)
- **Refactoring**: Each step must compile and pass all tests independently
